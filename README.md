For the first challege, `Horiseon Refactor` I went through the given HTML code and changed the `semantic tags` to make the code easier to understand and I also changed some of the `class` names to make it more clear what part the code was effecting. I added `alt` attributs to every image in the HTML file for accessibility. For the provided CSS code, I went through and orginized the code, putting the `type selectors` at the top, then grouping the `class selectors` together that flowed top to bottom of the webpage. I `consolidated classes` that were repetative and added `comments` above most of the classes to make it clear what those classes effected.
